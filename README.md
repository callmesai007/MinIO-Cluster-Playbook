## What is MinIO? üìÇ

MinIO is a high-performance distributed object storage server designed for large-scale private cloud infrastructure. It is compatible with Amazon S3 cloud storage service and is known for its high performance and scalability, making it an ideal choice for organizations dealing with large amounts of unstructured data.

## Why MinIO Cluster? üåê

Setting up a MinIO cluster offers several benefits such as:
- **High Availability:** Ensure consistent access to your data even in case of node failures.
- **Scalability:** Easily scale your storage cluster to accommodate growing data needs.
- **Performance:** MinIO's distributed architecture ensures high performance for data storage and retrieval.
- **Data Protection:** Replication and erasure coding mechanisms provide data protection against failures.

## Ansible Playbooks for MinIO Cluster üì¶

This repository includes Ansible playbooks designed to automate the setup and configuration of a MinIO cluster. The playbooks handle tasks such as:
- Installing and configuring MinIO server on multiple nodes.
- Setting up distributed object storage across the cluster.
- Configuring High Availability (HA) and Multi-Node setup for MinIO.
- Integrating MinIO with other DevOps tools.
